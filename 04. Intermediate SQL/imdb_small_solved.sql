#We can, because these two tables has the same values (and c'mon, everybody has a gender, directors arent objects or some-leftist-shit like non-binary stuff)
#we can generalize these two tables in "ActorDirectors" and their role will change if their id is in the "roles" table
#meaning that they are actors or if their id its in the "movies_directors" table, meaning that they are directors,
#and we can save some redundant information btw.

#Ejer 13
#Yes as explained above, some directors are actors and vice versa,
#with this logic we have "James Cameron" who is director and actor, and he occupies two tables with the same values
#this doesnt make sense as explained above in exercise 12.
